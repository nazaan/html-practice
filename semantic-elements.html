  <h1>My favorite superheroes: a semantic webpage!</h1>
  <h2>DC heroes</h2>
  <p><em>DC superheroes are the best.</em><br>
  The storylines are more complex and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite hero is <strong> Green blabla blabla</strong></p>
  <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever (lol)</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel hero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industry whereas DC attemps to capitalize on the TV and film blablablablablablablabla</p>
  <h4>Conclusion </h4>
  <p>But they do have recent movies and TV shows blablabla</p>
  <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
